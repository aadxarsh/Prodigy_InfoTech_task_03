* Objective: Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service using demographic and behavioral features.

* Key Steps:
           Loaded dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
           Preprocessed features (encoded categorical values, handled imbalance)
           Split data into training and test sets
           Built a DecisionTreeClassifier using sklearn
           Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

* Tools/Libraries:
Python, Pandas, jupyter notebook, vs code, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

* conclusion: This was pretty challenging.
